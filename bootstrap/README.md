This contains some sample data from Sensor Push and Tempest devices. It has the raw exported data from each device and a Python script to turn that into SQL to insert it into a DB with the schema from src/sql/CREATE.sql. We're committing the raw data to the repo to make it easier to do this bootstrap. It'll be compressed in .git, so it's not so huge as to be a problem. We do keep from committing the SQL to keep from double-bloating the repo for this test data.
