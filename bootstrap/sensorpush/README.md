Data from a few Sensor Push sensors from late August to early October 2020. The data is in Eastern time, so shift it by 4 hours to get UTC.

The office sensor has had the first 10 minutes of October 3rd in UTC deleted along with every other minute for 1:00 through 1:09 in UTC on the same day. The gaps there are used for testing the backend.
